    <p> Freshman Year in High school can be so tough meaning, adapting to new people, new surroundings. My freshman year I walked in only knowing a 4th of my class seeing that most of us went to the same middle school. I knew that there was going to be people I didn't know and it was scary. People looking at you down the hallways people point out what sneakers you are wearing , my school has uniform so we basically all look the same, but I became friends with every freshman in my class not because Iâ€™m well known but because I barely knew people. People come up to you and start conversation you try to follow trends that other people start. You just want to fit in. The major theme that will probably be following trends fitting in and making your circles, well everybody is going to be your friend </p>
    <p> Sophomore year is a year for challenges, it's the year for making mistakes and learning from them whether it be cheating on a test and receiving academic dishonesty or even that boyfriend, or girlfriend who just did you slime no matter what the case is you are gonna go through some stuff however this is the year when you lose some friends. A loss because either they are fake or because time just got the best of your relationship. But with the remaining circles that you have they will help you get through those challenging times. Also the clubs you were dying to join freshman year are probably making room for you now so live the year stress free be with friends and live happily because next year your hair will turn grey and fall out.</p>
